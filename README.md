# Hierarchical cluster analysis of Billboard 200 number-one albums

This study examines acoustic features of the Billboard 200 number-one albums’
content. The Billboard 200 is a record chart ranking the 200 most popular music
albums and EPs in the United States. It is published weekly by Billboard magazine. 
This study focuses on the Billboard 200 number-one albums from 5.1.1963
to 19.1.2019. In the nearly 60-year time span the music industry has undergone
dramatic changes. In this study, we explore the the number-one albums’ content’s
acoustic features in order to discover common and differentiating factors. We hope
to gain insight on the makings of best selling albums through the years.

We apply Ward error sum of squares hierarchical clustering method and use Dunn index
and average silhouette width to determine an optimal number of clusters. The method
produces a dendrogram partitioning the data into clusters, which we interpret
by inspecting normalized differences of cluster centroids.
